# Portfolio-2.0

This is portfolio page to showcase my work using only HTML and CSS. It is the first project we have to work on during the Multiverse
Bootcamp.

Instead of using a CSS Framework like bootstrap for responsiveness I used flexbox to better my understanding of it. 
I also used media queries for mobile responsiveness.

## Goals to meet
- [x] CSS in external stylesheet and linked to html via link tag
- [x] Margin vs. padding
- [x] Borders and Shadows
- [x] Fonts
- [x] Backgrounds: Colors/Images
- [x] Sizes: em, rem, px, %
- [x] Flexbox
- [x] Media Queries
- [x] Cascading and Specificity
- [x] no "!important" property

## Personal Goals
- [ ] Add a contact me form
- [ ] Incorporate some javascript
