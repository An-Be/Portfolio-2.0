# Portfolio-2.0

This is portfolio page to showcase my work using only HTML and CSS. It is the first project we have to work on during the Multiverse
Bootcamp.

Instead of using a CSS Framework like bootstrap for responsiveness I used flexbox to better my understanding of it. 
I also used media queries for mobile responsiveness.
