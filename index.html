            <h2>My interest in tech first started when I discovered game development. I did a lot of research and even ended up building a small version of Angry Birds using Unity and C#, it was super hard but extremely fun. At the time I was majoring in Art so I started incorporating more computer science classes into my curriculum. With the time I had left in college I was able to take classes like Intro to C++, Discrete Math, and Computer Science 101. Unfortunately, I did not have enough CS classes so I graduated with an Associates in Art. After graduating I immedatly did reasearch on how to become a better programmer and how to land a job in tech. I ended coming across Nucamp Bootcamp so I signed up immedatly. From here on everything went super quickly. I attended Nucamp where I learned Web and Mobile Developement using MERN stack. I later on was accepted into WOZ where I learned development with .Net. After graduated at WOZ I landed a job at Infosys where I learned a bit of Python and more .Net. Fast forward a few months I came across Multiverse with a help of a friend and loved everything about it. I quickly applied and after some time I was accepted into the program. It's all extremely surreal but after building small games in my bedroom from 8PM all the way till 5AM and thinking to myself that it would be way too hard to get into tech when I only had an associates in Art, I am now a Junior Software Engineer at American Express. </h2>
