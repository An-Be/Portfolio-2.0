        <p>
          My interest in tech first started when I discovered game development.
          I did a lot of research and even ended up building a small version of
          Angry Birds using Unity and C#, it was super hard but extremely fun.
          At the time I was majoring in Art so I started incorporating more
          computer science classes into my curriculum. With the time I had left
          in college, I was able to take classes like Intro to C++, Discrete
          Math, and Computer Science 101. Unfortunately, I did not have enough
          CS classes so I graduated with an Associate in Art. After graduating I
          immediately did research on how to become a better programmer and how
          to land a job in tech. I ended up coming across Nucamp Bootcamp so I
          signed up right away. From there on everything went super quickly. I
          attended Nucamp where I learned Web and Mobile Development using MERN
          stack. I, later on, was accepted into WOZ where I learned development
          with .Net. After graduating from WOZ I landed a job at Infosys where I
          learned a bit of Python and more .Net. Fast forward a few weeks, I
          came across Multiverse with a help of a friend and loved everything
          about it. I quickly applied and after some time I was accepted into
          the program. It's all extremely surreal but I went from self-learning
          game development every night to now being a Junior Software Engineer
          at American Express.

            Kerma is a website developed for a decentralized crypto wallet. It
            was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. I built
            Kerma during my time in the bootstrap course at Nucamp.

            watch movies. Users with policy, can do everything including delete
            movies.
